  "Instructions": [
    "Heat a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, swirl 1 tsp of the oil around, then add a tortilla. Sprinkle a handful of the cheese over one half of the tortilla, followed by some chicken and a few tomato slices. Season with a little salt and pepper. Cook for a few moments to melt the cheese, then fold over and cook until the tortilla is crisp.",
    "Turn the tortilla out of the pan and cut into quarters. Repeat with another flour tortilla to make another child\u2019s portion.",
    "For the adults\u2019 version, start by making a simple guacamole. Halve, stone, peel and slice the avocado, then mash it with the lime or lemon juice and a little seasoning.",
    "Make the tortillas as before, adding a little chopped coriander. Serve two each and cut into halves rather than quarters. Serve with the guacamole and soured cream, scattered with a little more coriander."
