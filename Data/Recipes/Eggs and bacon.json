    "Put the bacon strips in a large frying pan on medium-high. As bacon begins to cook, reduce heat to medium so the bacon doesn\u0027t spatter or burn. Cook slowly until it is done on one side; then turn and cook slowly on second side, to desired crispness.",
    "Remove pan from heat and transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and cover to keep it warm. Allow frying pan to cool for a few minutes before cooking eggs.",
    "Break each egg into a small cup or bowl and then slip egg into the warm bacon grease in pan. Place pan back over low heat and cook eggs slowly.",
    "When the eggs are cooked on the bottom, tip the pan and baste them with a little hot bacon grease to cook the tops. Cut the eggs apart with a spatula and lift onto a plate.",
    "Serve with buttered toast. Add jam, preserves, honey, apple butter, or a mixture of cinnamon and sugar."
